1.  Intro
    1.1 npm init => create an package.json
    1.2 git init => Initialized empty Git repository
    1.3 make a .gitignore file
    ``example:
    node_modules
    bundle.js //if you're using a module builder like webpack // assuming your bundled js file is called 'bundle.js', and is located in the root of your project folder
    bundle.js.map

2.  Express
    2.1 Install and Choose an Entry Point
    `./server/index.js`
    `npm install --save express`

    2.2 Create an app
    ```js
    const express = require('express');
    const app = express()
    ```

    2.3 Logging Middleware
    It hepls with debugging (even in production environments)
    Install and hook up
    Examples: `morgan`, `express-logger`, `volleyball`

    2.4 Static Middleware
    Require path - helps ensuring the right path to static files
    ```js
    const path = require('path')
    ```

    2.5 Parsing Middleware
    If we want to use the requests body as `req.body`, we need a middleware to parse the body
    `npm install --save body-parser`

    2.6 API Routes
    API: Application programming interface
    By convention, the start pointing is `/api`, to namespace them away from the front-end routes
    * Remember: When writting the api's, we don't need to re-write `/app/<apiName>` because we've composed our middleware together

    2.7 Handle 404s

    2.8 Send Index HTML (when buidling single page application)

    2.9 Handle 500 Errors
    4 arguments in the middleware

    2.10 Start the Server

3.  React
    3.1 Index HTML
    `This case: public/index.html`

    3.2 Basic Server
    How the HTML will be served? `Express` server or a quicker solution like `webpack-dev-server`, `http-server`, or some other static file server?
    `webpack-dev-server`: will listen to the localhost 8080 // need to install it // alternativelly `webpack --watch & http-server`


    3.3 Dev Dependencies
    `npm install --save-dev`
    --> `webpack webpack-cli babel-core babel-loader babel-preset-react`
      * making sure your code is safer for older browsers: `babel-preset-env`
      * newer language features: `babel-preset-stage-2`

    3.4 Regular Dependencies
    `npm install --save`
    --> `react react-dom react-router-dom`

    3.5 Index JS
    Decide on an `entry`and an `output` file for the webpack pipeline
    Entry: `this case: client/app.js`
    Output: will be created by webpack

    3.6 Webpack Config
    new file: `webpack.config.js`

    3.7 .babelrc
    new file: `.babelrc`
    Setting `babel-loader` in the webpack config, we are teaching webpack to use babel. However, we also need to tell babel hot to parse our code.

    3.8 ReactDOM Render
    In the `entry` file

    3.9 Start Script
    In `package.json`set up an npm star command

4.  Sequelize
    4.1 Create your database
    `createdb <dbName>` on terminal // comes with some installations of postgres

    4.2 Install
    `npm install --save sequelize pg pg-hstore` for sequelize with postgres

    4.3 Create Sequelize Instance
    invoke the Sequelize constructor and pass on it the database address
    ```js
    const db = new Sequelize(`postgres://localhost:5432/boilermaker`, {
    logging: false
    })
    ```
    4.4 Define your models and establish Associations
    models: http://docs.sequelizejs.com/manual/tutorial/models-definition.html
    in `./db/models`
    associations: http://docs.sequelizejs.com/manual/tutorial/associations.html
    in `./db/index.js`

    4.5 Sync your Database
    Best practice: before your server starts

5.  Redux
    5.1 Install
    `npm install --save redux react-redux`
    Common middlewares:
    `npm install --save redux-thunk redux-logger`

    5.2 Create a Reducer Function
    5.3 Create your store. Set up middlewares
    Methods in store:
    `dispatch(action)` --> the only way to trigger a state change
    `getState()` --> return the current state
    `subscribe(listener)` --> Listener will be called  any time an action is dispatched
    5.4 Provider
    In the root of the React app, import store and import the Provier from react-redux
    5.5 Define:
    `action types` --> Strings
    `action creators` --> functions that return an object with `type: string`
    `sub-reducers`
    `thunk creators` --> for Async actions
    5.6 Connect components
    Inside the components, use `connect`to obtain slices of `state` and the `dispatch` method

6.  Authentication
    6.1 Install
    `npm install --save express-session passport`
    6.2 Set up session middleware & Protect Session Secret
    6.3 OPTIONAL: Session store
    Store session information in postgres dtabase
    `npm install connect-session-sequelize`
    6.4 Initialize Passport
    attach user to request object

7.  OAuth

    `Google console`: https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard?project=boilermaker-demo-211119

8.  CSS

9.  Testing
    9.1 Install
    `npm install --save-dev mocha chai`
    `Mocha`: test framework - `describe` and `it`
    `Chai`: assertion library - `expect`, `should` and `assert` - http://www.chaijs.com/plugins/
    `npm install --save-dev supertest`
    `supertest`: a fake client. We can make CRUD request with it
    `npm install --save-dev enzyme`
    `enzyme`: A browserless abstraction for testing React components - https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme#installation
    Other libraries:
    `sinon`: provides spies, stubs and mocks
    `chai-as-promised`: extends chai with assertions specific to promises
    `chai-things`: extends chai with helpful assertions specific to arrays
    `sinon-as-promised`: extends sinon with sugar for promises
    `chai-enzyme`: extends chai with some convenience functions for working with enzyme
    9.2 Where to write Tests
    * Alongside the source code
    ** In a dedicated testing folder
    9.3 Test script
    Write it on `package.json`
    Also, `npm install --save-dev babel-register` to run test through `babel` // Add: `--compilers js:babel-register` on the script
    Watch for changes: `--watch`
    Configure babel: `.babelrc`
